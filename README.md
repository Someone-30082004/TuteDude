First.py:
This program starts by asking the user for a first number, which it reads as input and turns into an integer. Next, it asks for a second number and converts that input into an integer too. After getting both numbers, the program carries out four simple arithmetic operations: it adds the numbers, subtracts the second number from the first, multiplies them, and divides the first number by the second. Each result is saved in its own variable. Finally, the program shows all four results: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, by printing them one by one for the user to see.

Second.py:
This program starts by asking the user to type in their first name and saves it as text. Next, it asks for the user's last name and stores that too. Once both names are collected, the program combines the first and last name into a single full name. Finally, it shows a personalized greeting message that includes the user's full name, welcoming them to the Python program.
